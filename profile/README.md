OWASP CycloneDX is a lightweight Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standard designed for use in application security 
contexts and supply chain component analysis. 

The CycloneDX project provides standards in XML, JSON, and Protocol Buffers, as well as a large 
[collection of official and community supported tools](https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/) that create or interoperate 
with the standard. 

The projects website has many documented [use cases and examples](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/) that provide a 
springboard to SBOM adoption. 

The project operates as a [meritocracy](https://cyclonedx.org/about/governance/) whose 
[guiding principals](https://cyclonedx.org/about/guiding-principles/) reinforce its 
[risk-based approach to standards development](https://cyclonedx.org/about/standardization-process/). 
The project encourages [community participation](https://cyclonedx.org/about/participate/) in the development of the 
[standard and supporting tools](https://github.com/CycloneDX).
